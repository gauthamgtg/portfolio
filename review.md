COMPREHENSIVE PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS & RECOMMENDATIONS
As Senior HR Recruiter for Data/Product Analyst & Assistant PM Roles
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
First Impression: Mixed. Strong technical foundation with impressive project portfolio, but several critical issues prevent this from being a "must-interview" candidate at first glance.
Overall Grade: B- (75/100)

Technical Skills: A-
Presentation: C+
Role Alignment: B
Professional Credibility: B-
ATS/Recruiter Friendliness: C


🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (Fix Immediately)
1. Mismatch Between Title and Content
Problem: You call yourself "Data Analyst • Product Builder" but your portfolio screams "Full-Stack Developer"

60% of your projects are full-stack SaaS products
Only 8 projects out of 40+ are pure data analytics
Your "Why Me" section mentions "10+ products built" before mentioning data skills

Recruiter Thought: "Is this person a developer who does data on the side, or a data analyst? I'm confused about what role they actually want."
Fix:

Reposition as "Data Analyst & Product-Minded Analytics Professional"
Lead with data analytics projects, not full-stack apps
Create separate sections: "Analytics Projects" (featured) and "Technical Projects" (secondary)

2. The "Stats" Section Shows 0+, 0+, 0%+ Everywhere
Problem: All your "By The Numbers" statistics show placeholder zeros
Recruiter Thought: "Did they forget to fill this in? Is this portfolio unfinished? Red flag."
Fix:

Either fill with real numbers OR remove this section entirely
If you don't have exact numbers, remove it—better to have nothing than zeros

3. Redacted Project Name (XXXXX)
Problem: Your first featured project is called "XXXXX" with a private repo
Recruiter Thought: "Why is this hidden? Is this real work or just a template? Can I trust anything here?"
Fix:

Either use a real name or remove it from featured projects
If it's confidential work, describe it as "Confidential SaaS Platform" with anonymized details
Private repos are fine, but the placeholder name kills credibility

4. Resume Link Goes to External Site (FlowCV)
Problem: Your resume opens in FlowCV, not as a direct PDF download
Recruiter Thought: "I need to download this for our ATS. This is annoying. I might skip this candidate."
Fix:

Host a PDF version directly: [Download PDF Resume]
Many recruiters won't click through to third-party sites
ATS systems need uploadable PDFs

5. Overuse of Casual Language
Problem: Too many jokes, emojis, and casual phrases for a professional portfolio

"Torture the data, and it will confess to anything"
"I speak fluent Engineer, Designer, and Executive"
"besides coffee enthusiasm"
"way too much coffee ☕"
Footer: "This page was built with 0 lines of code (and counting!)"

Recruiter Thought: "Is this person serious about their career? Would they fit in a corporate environment?"
Fix:

Choose one or two personality touches, not thirty
Save the humor for your LinkedIn "About" section
Professional ≠ boring, but this is too casual for someone with 5+ years experience


🔴 HIGH-PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS
6. Poor Role Alignment for Product Analyst/APM
Current State: Your portfolio emphasizes:

SQL optimization (technical)
Dashboard building (technical)
Full-stack development (wrong role)

Missing for Product Roles:

Product metrics understanding (retention, LTV, CAC, activation)
Product experimentation & A/B testing methodology
User research insights
Feature prioritization frameworks
Product roadmap influence
Cross-functional collaboration stories
Business impact storytelling

Fix:
Create a new section: "Product Impact & Analytics"

Showcase how your analysis influenced product decisions
Highlight A/B tests that changed product direction
Include user journey optimization work (you have CleverTap experience!)
Demonstrate understanding of product funnels, not just data funnels

7. Experience Section Lacks Context
Problem: Your bullet points are metric-heavy but context-light
Current: "Reduced querying time by 30%"
Better: "Identified bottleneck in customer cohort queries affecting daily revenue reports. Redesigned schema and implemented derived tables, reducing query time from 45s to 13s (70% improvement) and enabling real-time dashboard for executive team."
Fix for Each Role:

Add 2-3 sentences of context before bullet points
Explain: What was broken? What did you do? What changed?
Use STAR format: Situation, Task, Action, Result

8. Skills Section is Generic
Problem: Just listing tools doesn't differentiate you
Recruiter Thought: "Everyone lists SQL and Python. What level of proficiency does this person actually have?"
Fix:
Add proficiency levels and specific use cases:
SQL (Expert - 5 years)
├─ Complex window functions, CTEs, query optimization
├─ BigQuery cost optimization, Postgres performance tuning
└─ Schema design for analytics workflows

Python (Advanced - 3 years)
├─ Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
├─ Automation scripts (saved 20+ hrs/week)
└─ Basic ML with scikit-learn

Tableau (Advanced - 4 years)
├─ Executive dashboards with 15+ data sources
├─ Performance optimization (90% slot time reduction)
└─ Custom calculations and LOD expressions
9. Missing: Analytics Case Studies
Problem: You have 8 full "View Case Study" links for SaaS products, but ZERO case studies for your analytics work
Recruiter Thought: "They put more effort into their side projects than their actual analytics work. Is data analytics really their focus?"
Fix:
Create detailed case studies for your top 3 analytics projects:

Revenue Calculation Overhaul at Zocket (business impact)
CleverTap Funnel Optimization (product analytics)
BigQuery Cost Optimization at Dunzo (technical excellence)

Include: Problem → Approach → Tools → Results → Learnings

🟡 MEDIUM-PRIORITY IMPROVEMENTS
10. Projects Are Not Prioritized by Relevance
Problem: Full-stack products appear first, analytics projects buried
Fix:
Reorganize project section:

Featured Analytics Work (3-4 projects)
Data Engineering & Automation (3-4 projects)
Product Analytics (2-3 projects)
Technical Side Projects (collapsed by default)

11. Weak "Why Me" Section for Analytics Roles
Current: Generic value propositions
Missing: Specific analytics superpowers
Fix:
Rewrite for analytics focus:

"Data-to-Decision Pipeline" → Rename to "Business Impact Through Data"
Add: "Analytics Velocity" (fast turnaround on analysis requests)
Add: "Data Quality Champion" (your schema redesign work proves this)
Remove: "Zero to Product Builder" (wrong signal for data analyst role)

12. Banking Experience Undersold
Problem: Your HDFC role (2 years!) is treated as least important
Reality: Banking/fintech experience is HIGHLY valuable for many product companies
Fix:

Move banking experience higher or create a "Domain Expertise" section
Highlight: Fraud analytics, risk modeling, pattern recognition
Many product companies need finance domain knowledge

13. No Mention of Data Stakeholder Management
Problem: Analytics is 50% communication, 50% technical skill
Missing: How you work with non-technical stakeholders
Fix:
Add a subsection under experience: "Key Stakeholders & Impact"

"Collaborated with Marketing, Product, Finance teams..."
"Translated technical findings into executive presentations..."
"Enabled self-service analytics for 15+ business users..."

14. GitHub Links Are Not Enough
Problem: Many projects just link to GitHub repos
Reality: Recruiters don't read code
Fix:
For each project, add:

📊 One screenshot or dashboard preview
📈 Key metric (e.g., "Analyzed 2M+ records")
💡 Business insight generated
⚡ Tool stack in badges

15. Contact Section is Buried at Bottom
Problem: I had to scroll through 40+ projects to reach your email
Fix:

Add a sticky "Contact Me" button in nav bar
Consider a hero section CTA: "Open to opportunities" with email


🟢 NICE-TO-HAVE IMPROVEMENTS
16. Add a "Recommendations" or "Testimonials" Section
Social proof matters. Add 2-3 LinkedIn recommendations or manager quotes.
17. Include Relevant Certifications
Do you have any?

Google Analytics
Tableau Desktop Specialist
SQL certifications
Product Analytics certificates

If yes, add them. If no, consider getting 1-2.
18. Blog or Thought Leadership
You mention an "SEO optimized blog" in one project. Do you write about analytics?

Add a "Writing" section if you have Medium/LinkedIn articles
Publish 2-3 posts on "How I optimized BigQuery costs" or "A/B testing pitfalls"

19. Add "Currently Exploring" Section
Shows growth mindset:

"Learning: Advanced Python for ML"
"Experimenting with: dbt for data transformation"
"Reading: Lean Analytics by Alistair Croll"

20. Improve Visual Hierarchy
Current: Everything has equal visual weight
Fix:

Featured projects: Large cards with images
Secondary projects: Smaller grid view
GitHub mini-projects: Collapsed "Show more" section


📊 DETAILED RECRUITER EVALUATION
What I Like:
✅ Strong Quantifiable Results: 30% faster queries, 15% revenue growth, $20K saved
✅ Relevant Company Experience: Zocket (SaaS) and Dunzo (quick commerce) are impressive
✅ Technical Depth: BigQuery optimization shows real expertise

❌ Portfolio Completion: Those 0+ stats suggest this isn't ready
❌ Over-Engineering: Too many projects, not enough depth on core analytics work
❌ Credibility Issues: Redacted project names and private repos raise questions
❌ Tone Mismatch: Too casual for senior roles (5+ years experience)
❌ Missing Product Mindset: No clear product analytics methodology
❌ ATS Compatibility: External resume link is a blocker

💼 ROLE-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS
If Applying for Data Analyst Roles:
Priority Changes:

Remove 60% of full-stack projects (keep 3-4 as "Technical Proficiency")
Feature: SQL optimization, dashboard building, data pipeline work
Add: More detail on CleverTap analytics, cohort analysis, funnel optimization
Emphasize: Business impact, stakeholder communication, self-service analytics

If Applying for Product Analyst Roles:
Priority Changes:

Create dedicated "Product Analytics" section
Highlight: A/B testing, user journey optimization, retention analysis
Add: Product experimentation framework, feature success metrics
Include: How your insights influenced product roadmap decisions
Show: Understanding of AARRR metrics, cohort behavior, activation

If Applying for Assistant Product Manager Roles:
Priority Changes:

Reposition as "Data-Driven Product Professional"
Feature: Product thinking, not just data analysis
Add: Examples of cross-functional collaboration
Include: How you prioritized features or influenced product strategy
Show: User empathy (even if from data), business acumen, execution ability
Consider: Separate "Product Portfolio" vs "Analytics Portfolio"


FINAL VERDICT
Would I reach out for an interview?
For Data Analyst role: Maybe (70% yes)

Strong technical skills and metrics
But portfolio presentation needs work
Concerns about focus and professionalism

For Product Analyst role: Probably not (40% yes)

Good data foundation
But lacks clear product analytics methodology
Missing product-specific case studies

For Assistant PM role: No (20% yes)

Too technically focused
Doesn't demonstrate product leadership or vision
Reads more like a developer portfolio

After implementing my recommendations: 95% yes for all three roles

BOTTOM LINE
Gautham, you have excellent raw material but poor packaging. Your experience at Zocket and Dunzo is genuinely impressive. Your technical skills are strong. Your quantified achievements are exactly what recruiters want to see.
But your portfolio sabotages you by:

Confusing your professional identity
Burying your best work under side projects
Looking unfinished (those 0+ stats!)
Being too casual for someone with your experience level

Fix the critical issues this week, and you'll 10x your response rate.
You're one solid revision away from having a portfolio that gets you interviews at top product companies. The talent is clearly there—now make the presentation match it.

                    Zocket's finance and leadership teams were making decisions based on inaccurate revenue data. The existing calculation logic failed to account for refunds, prorated subscriptions, and currency conversions properly—resulting in a 15% discrepancy between reported and actual revenue. Investor reports showed inflated numbers, creating credibility risks during fundraising.
